# Inventory-Levels-
The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to insights visualization and reporting. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the results in a clear and business-focused manner.

The project covers:

Data loading and exploration in Python

Data cleaning and preparation

SQL querying using a MySQL database

Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

Final reporting and presentation using Gamma

Dataset

Source: (Add source name or “Public dataset” / “Company-provided dataset”)

Format: CSV

Description: The dataset contains structured records used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators relevant to the business problem.
Rows: 17222, Coloumns: 21
(Optional: briefly mention number of rows/columns or main features.)

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

SQL: Data querying and analysis using MySQL

Power BI: Interactive dashboard and data visualization

Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation

Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and documentation

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial checks on structure, data types, and missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified anomalies, missing data, and potential outliers.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized column names and data formats.

Prepared clean data for SQL and visualization.

SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.

Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.

Aggregated and filtered data for insights.

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Visualized KPIs, trends, and comparisons.

Enabled filtering for dynamic analysis.

Reporting & Presentation

Summarized insights in a structured report.

Created a professional presentation using Gamma.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides: 

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis over time

Category and segment comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns in the data.

Highlighted areas of strong and weak performance.

Delivered actionable insights supported by data visualizations and SQL analysis.
Insights: 1. Stcok details must be clear and accurate data.
          2. Item desc is must visible.
          3.Real time tracking.
          4.Max and Min stock must be variate.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Install required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order.

Load the cleaned dataset into MySQL and execute the provided SQL queries.

Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.

Review the final report and presentation for summarized insights.

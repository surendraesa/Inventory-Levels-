The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data loading to insights visualization and reporting. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the results in a clear and business-focused manner.
 
** **   The project covers:****

1.Data loading and exploration in Python.

2.Data cleaning and preparation

3.SQL querying using a MySQL database

4.Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

Final reporting and presentation using Gamma

**Dataset:**

Source: (Add source name or “Public dataset” / “Company-provided dataset”)

Format: CSV

**Description:**
             The dataset contains structured records used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators relevant to the business problem.
              Rows: 17222, Coloumns: 21

**Tools & Technologies:**

1.Python: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

2.Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

3.SQL: Data querying and analysis using MySQL

4.Power BI: Interactive dashboard and data visualization

5.Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation

6.Jupyter Notebook: Analysis and documentation

**Project Steps:**

1.Data Loading

2.Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

3.Performed initial checks on structure, data types, and missing values.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

5.Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

6.Identified anomalies, missing data, and potential outliers.

7.Data Cleaning

8.Handled missing values and duplicates.

9.Standardized column names and data formats.

10.Prepared clean data for SQL and visualization.

**SQL Analysis (MySQL):**

1.Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.

2.Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.

3.Aggregated and filtered data for insights.

**Dashboard Development:** !
        <a https://github.com/surendraesa/Inventory-Levels-/blob/main/Inventary_Levels_Dashboard.pbix a>

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**Visualized KPIs, trends, and comparisons:**

Enabled filtering for dynamic analysis.

**Reporting & Presentation:**
        <a https://github.com/surendraesa/Inventory-Levels-/blob/main/Inventory-Levels-Analysis.pptx a>
 Summarized insights in a structured report.

Created a professional presentation using Gamma.

Delivered actionable insights supported by data visualizations and SQL analysis.

**Insights:** 1. Stcok details must be clear and accurate data.
              2. Item desc is must visible.
              3.Real time tracking.
              4.Max and Min stock must be variate.


Review the final report and presentation for summarized insights.
